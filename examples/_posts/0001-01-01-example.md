From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kml):

Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML file format for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within Internet-based, 2D maps and 3D Earth browsers.

The KML file specifies a set of features (placemarks, images, polygons, 3D models, textual descriptions, etc.) for display in Google Earth or any other geospatial software implementing the KML encoding. Each place always has a longitude and a latitude. Other data can make the view more specific, such as tilt, heading, altitude, which together define a "camera view".

KML files are very often distributed in KMZ files, which are zipped files with a .kmz extension. The contents of a KMZ file are a single root KML document and optionally any overlays, images, icons, and COLLADA 3D models referenced in the KML including network-linked KML files.

To use kmlncl functions, simply load the **kmlncl** library at the beginning of your NCL script:

    load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
    load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"
    load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/contributed.ncl"
    load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/shea_util.ncl"
    load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/kml/kml.ncl"

 Note that using the **kmlncl** library requires loading several other standard NCL libraries.
